Ol√°! I'm a **graphic designer** born & raised in Portugal, currently living and working in **Pittsburgh, PA**. I have a sweet tooth for **branding**, **digital + print design**, and **strategy**. 
In every project I aim to surpass my creative boundaries and learn from every experience, creating relevant well-crafted work with a careful attention to detail. It gives me great joy to come up with thoughtful and creative ideas that work.
