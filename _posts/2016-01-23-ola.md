## I'm a **communication & multimedia designer** living and working in **Pittsburgh, PA**. 

I have a sweet tooth for **branding**, **digital + print design,** and **strategy**. In every project I aim to surpass my creative boundaries and learn from every experience, creating relevant well-crafted work with a careful attention to detail. It gives me great joy to come up with thoughtful and creative ideas that work.
